EECS_293 Project 4
David Pendergast
dlp75@case.edu

Included are all specified classes with specified methods.  One unspecified change I made was giving Users a set of links, which is used to store all the links of which they are a member,  this makes creating neighborhoods easier and more efficient.

The Ant Build file should be able to build and run junit tests for the project.

Again, the project is named project 2, but it is project 5.
